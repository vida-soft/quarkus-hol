= Developing JavaEE applications with Quarkus

== What is this course about?

https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] is the most up to date framework to develop server applications using the JavaEE spec.
Its scalability, compactness and flexibility allows for quicker setup, development process and deployment, unlike any other traditional JavaEE server out there.

Most common problems with servers running JavaEE are:

* Difficulty during setup - it usually takes a lot of time to set the development environment up and running.
Most application servers require changing some configurations here and there.
The configuration files have specific formats and structures difficult for the human to read. 
They are too large and most of the time contain a lot of server-related configurations, you will never have to change.
This makes for cluttered environment, where it is very easy to mess up the configuration and spend hours trying to find a missing closing bracket or wrongly formatted section,
just for configuring the database for that particular project.

* Tedious development - every time a change is introduced to the code, redeployment is needed.
Redeployments take time.
Hotswaps don't usually work.
Sometimes it takes seconds, sometime minutes and if there was an ongoing session, you'll have to log in again, without being able to continue from where you last left.
This can turn into such a hassle and productivity killer.

* Deployment and scalability issues - imagine having to set up all of those configurations to multiple instances.
Configuring distributed systems is difficult in the first place.
Yes, having Docker containers and automated provisioning with Terraform scripts makes this simpler, but most times these tools are difficult to configure on their own.
Having yet another thing to worry about wouldn't make it any easier, would it?

* Footprint - most application servers take a lot of system memory and time to even start running.
The presence of so many configuration options and those large config files suggests that there is too much stuff that has to be loaded, before the application has even started.
Stuff you might never need to use and stuff that is taking up your system memory.
This makes conventional java servers inappropriate for running on small environments or being used as a serverless solution.

These are the most obvious ones.
You can go on with as many examples you want, but let's see how Quarkust tackles those:

* Difficulty during setup - setting up your project is as easy as it can be.
When getting started, you can go to https://code.quarkus.io[code.quarkus.io] and build your project template from scratch or use Quarkus CLI, or Maven to choose how to configure your project.
If you are running an existing project, most of the times all that is needed is to set all the system parameters needed for your project and run the application with a simple command.
More of that you'll find in the course.

* Tedious development - deploying a Quarkus project is easy and quick.
Once you have your application running, you would rarely need to restart the server again.
You could modify the configuration in runtime, or change the code.
Having those changes reflected is as simple as refreshing the page, similar to a NodeJS application.

* Deployment and scalability issues - Quarkus comes with tools and presets for Dockerization out of the box.
You can simply configure those as your own taste desires and create images and deployments with the neat CLI the framework has provided.
When it comes to scaling your application, it's one step out of the way.

* Footprint - applications running under Quarkus take up only the space that is needed to run the components of your project.
There is nothing extra.
Only the stuff your application is using.
Having said that, Quarkus has its own extensions and JavaEE implementations, optimized for quick and minimal environment.
It also allows for building native executables, which take even smaller portion of the system and run significantly fast.
Applications can start in less then a second.
This makes Quarkus applications great for serverless execution.
Don't believe that? https://quarkus.io/blog/runtime-performance/[Here's some proof].

This course intents to walk you through the specifics of Quarkus, using the JavaEE specification.
At the end you should be able to have the basic knowledge set to create and maintain Quarkus applications.
The course does not intent to get you deep into the concepts of JavaEE and the Quarkus framework, so if you need to know more, always feel free to check:
