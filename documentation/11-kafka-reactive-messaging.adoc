== Reactive messaging with Kafka

At this moment we have learned how two applications can communicate with each-other using the REST interfaces offered by RestEasy.
The HTTP REST protocol works perfectly when the client wants to pass a request and is waiting for a response immediately after the request was sent.
In a small and controlled environment like our project structure here, this will happen lightning fast. 
You send a request and you get a response under a second.

In a real environments though, we don't usually tend to get things done so quickly.
To make the user experience more seamless, we pretend that things have happened, before they do.

.A.N.(AmazoN) example
***************************
Imagine you are browsing through a shopping catalog in Amazon and you see something that you want to buy.
Sometimes Amazon will give you the option to purchase the item you're looking at with a single click, without having to verify your payment and shipping information.
Other times it will ask you explicitly provide this data or at least confirm it.
You click the check-out button, wait just 2-3 seconds, and BOOM! Order is completed.

> But has it really been completed? ðŸ¤”

The answer is no.
To keep the user from waiting, Amazon will do some tricks under the hood.
First it will show that the purchase has been completed, but it is not really completed it is just registered as pending.
Then all the associated servers start doing their thing to check if the item is still available, if your shipping data is correct and contact your bank to withdraw the money from your account.
And Amazon is doing this process fpr thousands of purchases simultaneously.

Depending on REST services in such a scenario is inefficient, as it requires for every customer to wait until their query has been processed by every system that is connected to your purchase.
Imagine having to wait on the huge line just to buy a ticket to watch a movie, and the movie has already started.
This would be very bad user experience.
Nobody would visit that cinema again right?

To prevent such a scenario from happening Amazon is using some type of messaging services.
Let's see how the messaging services could mitigate the process of purchasing an item:

. The customer checks out their purchase and completes the order.
. A REST call containing information about the order has been received inside an Amazon server.
. The server sends out an OK response to the front-end system to tell the customer that the order was completed.
. Asynchronously the server sends out a message to the various distributed services within Amazon about the purchase:
.. One reads that message and saves the order in the customer's order history
.. Another message goes to the delivery department to notify the systems that an order has to be processed
.. A third system will take the customer's payment details and conduct a payment transaction with the payment provider of choice
.. Finally when all the processes are completed another system will send the user an email about the completion state of the order.

In this scenario if the payment and shipment information has been processed correctly, the user will receive an email, stating that the order is completed and the items are being processed.
If something fails, the customer will be notified through email or through the app/website to re-submit their details.
In the end this is creating a seamless flow, where the customer's experience, that seems smooth, they can continue shopping or do other stuff, while the order is being processed.
In most scenarios there even shouldn't be a problem with the payment and the order for recurring customers, so they for example can benefit from purchasing items without having to wait for the system to process everything.
***************************

=== So what are messaging services?

Imagine a group chat with various participants but for web application services.
Instead of each service having to call one-another to exchange information, they will write to the group chat.
Let's use our aforementioned example and imagine it has three services:

* A "checkout" service that processes every order
* A "payments" service that will contact payment providers and charge the customer
* A "mailing" service that will collect various results from the services above and send emails to the customer

In a big platform like Amazon such a decentralization of services is inevitable, if they want to alleviate the high load of requests happening every second and better maintain the services' functionality.
In most scenarios all the services will communicate using some kind of messaging system.
Usually messaging systems like human-made ones have so-called channels, threads or topics, resembling groups, and participants, resembling the services themselves.
In our example the participants are our services, and they can write and read messages from various channels or various actions upon reading a message.

.This image displays a very simplified version of how applications can communicate through a messaging service.
image::messaging.png[align=center]

In a nutshell when an order is confirmed by the Checkout service, it will send a message to the Messaging service in a "group" called "orders".
In that same group "Mailing" and "Payments" are also participants.
They will receive the message and act accordingly.
The payments service will call the payment provider using the customer's payment details and the Mailing service will assemble an email, confirming the customer's order and send it through an SMTP protocol.

Once the payment has been processed, if something fails, there might be another group chat (topic), called "Payment Failures" where Payments and Mailing participate.

TIP: To keep it simple, such a scenario is not found in the diagrams.
The term for this is known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_letter_queue[Dead Letter Queue].

If "Payments" writes to this topic, all other participants, such as Mailing, will read from it, and in the case of Mailing, it will assemble a an email stating what is wrong with the payments.

In all the stated scenarios, just like in real life, the service is not obligated to wait for the response of the other services.
They just write the message to the topic and move on to the next action.
The Checkout service does not need to know if the user's payment has gone through.
The customer needs to know.
Therefore, it is more convenient to notify them through email, instead of waiting for their details to be processed in a queue with dozen other order queries.

=== We can't send a message without a messenger

There are a lot of protocols and implementations of messaging services around the internet.
All of them might work differently, but in their core, they serve the same purpose - an application writes to a topic, where other applications can read from and act upon receiving the message.

As mentioned, messages can be transmitted and received through various protocols and services, most of which are using TCP, AMQP and MQTT.
Depending on the type and uses for the applications, we might want to implement different types of protocols for different scenarios.
TCP and AMQP messaging services for example are more advanced than MQTT, whereas MQTT is lightweight and allows for quick communication between IoT devices, which are small servers on their own.

For the purpose of our course we are going to look through one of the most popular messaging service implementations, called Apache Kafka.
Kafka is using the TCP protocol to allow communication between its components and participants. In the following section you'll be able to learn more about Kafka in a summary.

.What is Apache Kafka?
***************************
**Apache Kafka** (or Kafka for short) is an open-source distributed event streaming platform designed for handling real-time data feeds. It facilitates the seamless flow of data between different systems, enabling efficient communication in distributed architectures.

In other words, Kafka allows for two applications to communicate through so-called topics, where one application writes to the topic an the other reads from it.

Kafka works, through the following principles:

. **Push-Subscribe Model:**
- Kafka follows a publish-subscribe model, where data is published to topics by producers.
- Consumers subscribe to specific topics to receive and process the published data.
. **Topics and Partitions:**
- Data is organized into topics, acting as channels for communication.
- Topics are further divided into partitions to enable parallel processing and scalability.
. **Producers and Consumers:**
- **Producers:** Applications that send data to Kafka topics.
- **Consumers:** Applications that subscribe to topics and process the data.
. **Broker Architecture:**
- Kafka operates with a distributed architecture consisting of multiple servers called brokers.
- Brokers store and manage the data, ensuring fault tolerance and high availability.

To be able to work with Kafka, we nee to learn the names and purpose of each participant component:

. **Producer:**
- Responsible for publishing data to Kafka topics.
- Ensures the delivery of messages to the specified topics.
. **Consumer:**
- Subscribes to topics to receive and process data.
- Can be part of a consumer group for load balancing and fault tolerance.
. **Broker:**
- Kafka servers that store and manage data.
- Each broker in a cluster is aware of the data distribution and can serve as a leader or follower for partitions.
. **Topic:**
- A logical channel for data streams.
- Data is organized into topics, and each topic can have multiple partitions.
. **Partition:**
- Divides a topic into smaller, independently manageable segments.
- Enables parallel processing and scalable data consumption.
. **Zookeeper:**
- Coordinates and manages the Kafka brokers in a distributed setup.
- Maintains configuration information, leader election, and synchronization.

In summary, Apache Kafka simplifies real-time data streaming by providing a robust infrastructure for handling large-scale, distributed data flows among different components and systems.
***************************

After understanding what Kafka is, let's see how our Amazon application participants would use it in a real-life scenario

image::kafka.png[align=center]

NOTE: The image shows a hypothetical scenario how Kafka could work as a messaging service with Amazon's services.
A zookeeper may contain more than one broker and each service would read from/write to the first available broker it gets connected to.

TIP: To get a better understanding of Apache Kafka, please refer to the official website: https://kafka.apache.org

=== Applying Kafka to our project

Now that we know what Kafka is and how it works, let's see how it could be applied to our project.

Currently, we have created our MagMan project for the Magazine Manager and SpendPal, that is responsible for charging our customers for the subscription services.
The way it works is the MagMan performs a REST call to SpendPal every time we want to charge a customer.
Let's visualize how this flow works right now.

image::rest-communication.png[align=center]

As we can see from our sophisticated diagram, the process requires for the subscriber to wait for SpendPal to process the payment request, before getting a response.
Just as mentioned earlier, this process wouldn't take that long if there were a couple of customers to pay for this feature, but we're using the power of
distributed web applications for way bigger scenarios.
Imagine if the customer was not just one, but hundreds or even thousands of them.
This is the point where REST services would bottleneck the user experience, as each payment will have to wait in line to be processed and the customer will not be able to use the platform meanwhile.

Now let's see how our diagram would look if we add the Kafka infrastructure to our service...

image::magman-kafka.png[align=center]

Now regardless if the diagram looks a bit more intimidating, if we follow along we can see, that:

. The user makes a payment providing their payment details
. MagMan sends a message to a Kafka topic to notify all its listeners that a payment has occurred
. The user gets the confirmation from MagMan and can move onto using the site
. The rest of the process is managed in the background without the subscriber's knowledge,
i.e. the payment gets processed and the SpendPal service returns a response message in a separate dedicated topic, which is read by MagMan
. If the result of the payment was successful, we can allow the user to continue using the site, without any interventions, if not,
we might trigger a mechanism to stop the user from using the website and ask them to provide payment information again.

With messaging systems we want to implement one way communication as each message payload is unique to the dedicated topic.
We also do not want to double read a topic when we publish something in it.
This is the reason behind having two topics to write and read from.

- The `payments` topic is designed to be read only by SpendPal service.
It will contain data regarding payment information, such as credit card info, subscription type and so on.
- The `post-payments` topic is designed to be read by MagMan.
It will contain, as the name suggests, post payment information, such as the payment status, timestamps, any error messages and so on.

Both topics are read and written to in a queue (FIFO) manner, meaning that we read the messages from top to bottom and every new message will be read and processed when the previous message
has completed processing.
Once the message was read, the Kafka broker will remember which messages were read and will provide the subscriber applications only with the unread messages.

=== Setting up Kafka for our services

Before we mess up with our project we will first need to set up our Kafka infrastructure.
As mentioned in the previous chapters Kafka consists of many server components that need to be hosted somewhere in order for
our applications to be able to connect, write and read messages.

Setting up Kafka manually is a bit complicated and requires some configurations, network adjustments and so on.
Thankfully there is the thing called https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker].
And this is the perfect time to learn what it is and how to install it on your machine.
If you follow the link above, the process should be quite straight-forward.

TIP: Although we are going to use Docker for simplicity, there's nothing stopping you from going wild and trying to configure a Kafka broker yourself.
Fell free to go through these steps in a way that is comfortable to you.

WARNING: Installing Docker on some operating systems like Ubuntu, might force you to install a version from their official app store, known as Snapcraft.
Installing Docker form there might not always give the desired results, when it comes to user permissions and access for the application to system resources.
You might also not be gating the latest version of Docker, as these apps seem to not be maintained officially by the vendor.
If you experience such issues, please make sure to delete all Snapcraft installations of Docker and install the official version from the Docker website.

Now that we have an idea how to set up the Kafka environment, the following steps will concentrate on using Docker for the set-up.
The easiest way to get our Kafka docker container up and running is by creating a `docker-compose` script.
If you have installed Docker properly, you should be able to invoke `docker-compose` from your terminal.

The next step is to create a docker-compose file.
To do so, simply create a file, called `docker-compose.yml` into your project folder and place the following content inside:

[source, yaml]
----
version: '3'
services:

  zookeeper: <.>
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000

  kafka: <.>
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    ports:
      - '9092:9092'
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:29092,PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:9092
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1

  create-topics: <.>
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka
    depends_on:
      - kafka
    entrypoint: [ '/bin/sh', '-c' ]
    command: |
      "
      # blocks until kafka is reachable
      kafka-topics --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 --list

      echo -e 'Creating kafka topics'
      kafka-topics --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 --create --if-not-exists --topic payments --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1
      kafka-topics --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 --create --if-not-exists --topic post-payments --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1

      echo -e 'Successfully created the following topics:'
      kafka-topics --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 --list
      "
----
<.> First we need a Zookeeper where our Kafka instance will live in
<.> Next is the Kafka server (the Broker), which needs to know where the Zookeeper is, in order for it to work
<.> Finally this is a single time run script, that will create the topics where our publishers and subscribers will read and write to.

And now it's time to run a docker-compose script.

. Open a terminal window inside the project folder or where you left the `docker-compose.yml` file.
. Write the command `docker-compose up` and press enter
. Some logs will appear.
When the logs stop you should be able to see the following result within:
+
image::docker-compose-success.png[align=center]
. Now let's check that everything is fine and the containers are running.
There are two ways to check that
.. Open another terminal window and write the command `docker container ls`.
You should be seeing exactly two running containers
+
image::docker-container-ls.png[align=center]
.. If you have installed Docker Desktop, you should see the two running containers in the containers tab as well
+
image::docker-containers-docker-desktop.png[align=center]
+
NOTE: Don't worry that the `create-topics` container is down.
Its purpose was to create the required topics and shut down.
All we need to do now is implement the Producer and Subscriber logic in out applications.

Having our Kafka server set up, it is time to configure our applications to support Kafka.

. Go to the `pom.xml` file of each application and add a new Quarkus extension:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
. Go to each app's `application.properties` file and add the respective properties to enable the app to read and write messages:
.. For MagMan
+
[source,properties]
----
kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092

mp.messaging.outgoing.payments.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.payments.topic=payments

mp.messaging.incoming.post-payments.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.post-payments.topic=post-payments
mp.messaging.incoming.post-payments.group.id=${quarkus.uuid}
----
.. For SpendPal
+
[source,properties]
----
kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092

mp.messaging.incoming.payments.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.payments.topic=payments
mp.messaging.incoming.payments.group.id=${quarkus.uuid}

mp.messaging.outgoing.post-payments.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.post-payments.topic=post-payments
----
+
TIP: Notice that the configurations look the same, but the state of `incoming`/`outgoing` is inverted.
This is reflecting our will to make MagMan only write to the `payments` topic and read from `post-payments` topic.
The same goes for SpendPal inverse.

. The final thing we need to do in order to have things up and running is to define a class that will handle messages.
.. Create a new package and class in each respective project, called `kafka.KafkaMessageService` or something that feels closer to your heart.
The point here is to have a dedicated class for this to keep our code structure clear
. For MagMan in this class now you can define the following methods:
+
[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class KafkaMessageService {

    @Inject
    @Channel("payments")
    Emitter<String> paymentsEmitter;

    @Incoming("post-payments")
    public void consumePostPaymentMessage(String message) {

    }

    public void sendPaymentsMessage(PaymentPayload payload) {

    }

}

//Where Payments payload can be a record or POJO in a separate class object

public record PaymentPayload(String username, CreditCardDTO creditCardDTO) {
}
----
. Do the same shenanigan in SpendPal, but inversed.
. Now when you try to run the projects you should be able to see the following logs:
+
.The log messages here signify that our applications are talking to the configured topics and are ready to consume and produce messages.
image::kafka-connected-success.png[align=center]

=== Implementing the messaging service in our project

Now that we have set up communication between our two applications through Kafka, we need to refactor the code so that they can actively use channels of communication we established.

For now, we won't get rid of the REST communication between the two.
We would want a fallback mechanism in case the communication with Kafka seizes to work.
Let's first implement our producer and consumer logic in each respective project...

In MagMan we agreed that we want to publish messages through the `payments` channel and consume messages from SpendPal.
To do so, we will need to convert the `PaymentsPayload` record into a JSON string, which is going to be transmitted as our message to Kafka and then we want to use our injected `paymentsEmitter` object to send the message.

[source, java]
----
public void sendPaymentsMessage(PaymentPayload payload) {
    String payloadString = JsonbBuilder.create().toJson(payload); <.>
    paymentsEmitter.send(payloadString).toCompletableFuture().join(); <.>
    LOGGER.info("Successfully emitted message to payments topic: %s".formatted(payloadString)); <.>
}
----
<.> We use Jsonb's serialization capabilities to convert our Java object into the expected output format which is of type `String`.
<.> For now we need to make the emitter synchronous as it may cause the `@Transactional` scope of invoking methods to leak in the asynchronous thread, which will throw an exception for https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/18450[establishing connection without transaction].
<.> We're placing this log, as this operation will happen behind the scenes and we want to confirm that what we sent is what we expected.
**Please do not log credit card information in your real-world applications!**

The next step will be to implement the consumer logic within SpendPal.

[source,java]
----
@Incoming("payments")
public void consumePostPaymentMessage(String message) {
    PaymentPayload payload = JsonbBuilder.create().fromJson(message, PaymentPayload.class);
    LOGGER.info("Received message with payload: %s".formatted(message));
}
----

To keep things simple, we're not going to do anything with the payload. We're just going to track the logs and see that messages are sent and received correctly.

Now that we have built the handling of the `payments` topic, we can sneak in the message sending method into our Payment service.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class PaymentService {

    ...

    @Inject
    KafkaMessageService kafkaMessageService;

    boolean chargeSubscriber(Subscriber subscriber) throws SpendPalException {
        if (subscriber.creditCard != null) {
            CreditCardDTO creditCardDTO = new CreditCardDTO(subscriber.creditCard);
            try {
                kafkaMessageService.sendPaymentsMessage(new PaymentPayload(subscriber.userName, creditCardDTO)); <.>
                return true;
            } catch (Exception e) { <.>
                LOGGER.severe(e.getMessage());
                ConfirmationDTO paymentResult = spendPalClient.chargeCustomer(new CreditCardDTO(subscriber.creditCard));
                LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Charging subscriber with id: {0}  and card type {1} of number: {2}",
                        new Object[]{subscriber.id, subscriber.creditCard.creditCardType, subscriber.creditCard.number});

                if (paymentResult.getSuccess()) {
                    LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Successfully charged customer with id: {0}  and card type {1} of number: {2}",
                            new Object[]{subscriber.id, subscriber.creditCard.creditCardType, subscriber.creditCard.number});
                    onSubscriberCharged.fire(subscriber);
                    return true;

                } else {
                    LOGGER.log(Level.WARNING, "Unable to charge customer with id: {0}  and card type {1} of number: {2}",
                            new Object[]{subscriber.id, subscriber.creditCard.creditCardType, subscriber.creditCard.number});

                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

}
----
<.> Since we are going to trust on both systems doing their thing in the background, we consider that the payment information has been sent once the message is emitted through Kafka.
<.> As we mentioned, we are not going to get rid of the REST call SpendPal, we are just going to use it as a fallback mechanism.

After you have refactored the code, it is time to test it.
Make sure you have configured a user correctly and send a request to charge subscriber.

[source,curl]
----
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/subscription' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer bearing'
----

What you are expected to see as a result is log messages stating the successfulness of the message transmission in both services.

[source,text]
----
In Magman
2024-02-07 13:55:02,285 INFO  [com.vid.mag.mes.KafkaMessageService] (executor-thread-1) Successfully emitted message to payments topic: {"creditCardDTO":{"number":"123456778893233242","type":"VISA"},"username":"cave123"}

And in SpendPal
2024-02-07 13:55:02,285 INFO  [com.vid.mag.mes.KafkaMessageService] (executor-thread-1) Successfully emitted message to payments topic: {"creditCardDTO":{"number":"123456778893233242","type":"VISA"},"username":"cave123"}
----

Now that we know it works, we can do the opposite thing for the `post-payments` topic.

In SpendPal

[source, java]
----
@Incoming("payments")
public void consumePostPaymentMessage(String message) {
    PaymentPayload payload = JsonbBuilder.create().fromJson(message, PaymentPayload.class);
    LOGGER.info("Received message with payload: %s".formatted(message));

    PaymentConfirmation paymentConfirmation = new PaymentConfirmation(payload.username(), new ConfirmationDTO(true, LocalDateTime.now()));
    sendPaymentsMessage(paymentConfirmation);
}

public void sendPaymentsMessage(PaymentConfirmation confirmation) {
    String payload = JsonbBuilder.create().toJson(confirmation);
    postPaymentsEmitter.send(payload);
    LOGGER.info("Successfully sent payment confirmations with payload: %s".formatted(payload));
}
----

And in MagMan

[source, java]
----
@Incoming("post-payments")
public void consumePostPaymentMessage(String message) {
    PaymentConfirmation paymentConfirmation = JsonbBuilder.create().fromJson(message, PaymentConfirmation.class);
    LOGGER.info("Received payment confirmation for username %s and status %s".formatted(paymentConfirmation.username(), paymentConfirmation.confirmationDTO().getSuccess()));
}
----

Now every time you send a new request to charge customer, you will see two additional logs in MagMan.

[source, text]
----
2024-02-07 14:38:45,689 INFO  [com.vid.mag.mes.KafkaMessageService] (executor-thread-1) Successfully emitted message to payments topic: {"creditCardDTO":{"number":"123456778893233242","type":"VISA"},"username":"cave123"}
2024-02-07 14:38:47,887 INFO  [com.vid.mag.mes.KafkaMessageService] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-3) Received payment confirmation for username cave123 and status true

----
This signifies that the communication between the two services is working properly.

=== Let's put our subscriptions into use shall we?

Since our Kafka communication is working it is time to do something with those subscriptions, not just pass messages.
Let's make it so that our system can keep track of the Subscriber's subscription status.

. Create a new entity, called Subscription
+
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Subscription extends AbstractEntity {

    @ManyToOne
    public Subscriber subscriber;

    //We need to support three types of statuses here: PENDING, VALID and FAILED
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    public SubscriptionStatus status = SubscriptionStatus.PENDING;

    public LocalDateTime initiated = LocalDateTime.now();

    public LocalDateTime completed;

    public Subscription() {

    }

    public Subscription(Subscriber subscriber) {
        this.subscriber = subscriber;
    }

    public static Optional<Subscription> findLastPendingSubscription(Subscriber subscriber) {
        return find("subscriber=?1 and status='PENDING'", Sort.descending("initiated"), subscriber)
                .firstResultOptional();
    }
}
----
. Optimise the event handling upon new subscription
+
[source,java]
----
public class SubscriptionExtensionHandler {
    ...
    @Transactional
    @ActivateRequestContext
    public void observeSubscriptionExtension(@Priority(Priorities.APPLICATION + 2000) @Observes @ChargedSubscriber SubscriberChargedPayload payload) { <.>
        Subscriber subscriber = Subscriber.getEntityManager().merge(payload.subscriber()); //making sure that the subscriber entity is attached

        Subscription subscription = Subscription.findLastPendingSubscription(payload.subscriber())
                .orElse(new Subscription(payload.subscriber()));
        if (payload.confirmation().getSuccess()) {
            subscriber.subscribedUntil = subscriber.subscribedUntil.plusYears(1);
            subscription.status = SubscriptionStatus.VALID;
            LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Extended subscription for user {0}, till {1}",
                    List.of(subscriber.id, subscriber.subscribedUntil.toString()).toArray());
        } else {
            subscription.status = SubscriptionStatus.FAILED;
        }

        subscription.completed = payload.confirmation().getTimestamp();
    }

    public void sendEmail(@Priority(Priorities.APPLICATION + 1000) @Observes @ChargedSubscriber SubscriberChargedPayload payload) {
        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Sent email to subscriber {0}, about their subscription renewal.", payload.subscriber().id);
    }
}
----
<.> Here we used to pass just the `Subscriber` as a payload, but now as we are processing more information, regarding the subscription, we will need a more detailed payload, requiring us to change the event payload itself.
Here is an example of how that payload should look:
+
[source,java]
----
public record SubscriberChargedPayload(Subscriber subscriber, ConfirmationDTO confirmation) { }
----
. Now let's go back to the Payment service and refactor some logic there
+
[source,java]
----
@Transactional
public boolean chargeSubscriber(Subscriber subscriber) throws SpendPalException {
        subscriber = Subscriber.getEntityManager().merge(subscriber); //We make sure that the subscriber instance is attached to the entity manager.
    failPreviousSubscriptionAttempt(subscriber); <.>

    Subscription subscription = new Subscription(subscriber);
    subscription.persist(); <.>

    if (subscriber.creditCard != null) {
        CreditCardDTO creditCardDTO = new CreditCardDTO(subscriber.creditCard);
        try {
            kafkaMessageService.sendPaymentsMessage(new PaymentPayload(subscriber.userName, creditCardDTO));
            return true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            LOGGER.severe(e.getMessage());
            return chargeSubscriberThroughRest(subscriber); <.>
        }
    } else {
        subscription.status = SubscriptionStatus.FAILED; <.>
        subscription.completed = LocalDateTime.now();
        return false;
    }
}

private void failPreviousSubscriptionAttempt(Subscriber subscriber) {
    Subscription.findLastPendingSubscription(subscriber)
            .ifPresent(s -> {
                s.status = SubscriptionStatus.FAILED;
                s.completed = LocalDateTime.now();
            });
}
----
<.> This operation is performed just to make sure there are no subscriptions left in `PENDING`, because we are creating a new `PENDING` one.
<.> As defined in the `Subscription` class, by default every new subscription gets the status `PENDING` so we do not need to set it explicitly here.
<.> To make this method short and more readable, the logic behind our fallback mechanism has been moved to a dedicated method.
<.> Since we have persisted the subscription, it is managed by the Entity Manager and every other change within the `@Transactional` scope will commit to the transaction, without needing to call `persist()` on the method again.

. If you have not done this yet, feel free to extend the  `UserDTO` class to see more information upon user login.
For example you can add `subscribedUntil` date to it, so wen the client gets a login response, they can immediately check if the user is subscribed or not.
. The final step is to handle the `KafkaMessageService` class.
Here we will need to inject the event for `@ChargedSubscriber` and invoke it, once we receive a message from Kafka.
+
[source,java]
----
    @Inject
    @ChargedSubscriber
    Event<SubscriberChargedPayload> subscriberChargedEvent;

    @Transactional
    @Incoming("post-payments")
    public void consumePostPaymentMessage(String message) {
        PaymentConfirmation paymentConfirmation = JsonbBuilder.create().fromJson(message, PaymentConfirmation.class);
        Subscriber subscriber = Subscriber.find("userName", paymentConfirmation.username()).firstResult();
        LOGGER.info("Received payment confirmation for username %s and status %s".formatted(paymentConfirmation.username(), paymentConfirmation.confirmationDTO().getSuccess()));

        if (subscriber == null) {
            LOGGER.warning("No subscriber with the user name of '%s' was found.".formatted(paymentConfirmation.username()));
        }

        SubscriberChargedPayload eventPayload = new SubscriberChargedPayload(subscriber, paymentConfirmation.confirmationDTO());
        subscriberChargedEvent.fire(eventPayload);
    }

    public void sendPaymentsMessage(PaymentPayload payload) {...}
}
----

These steps now should be sufficient to demonstrate how our application can act upon sending and receiving Kafka messages.

=== What next?

Now that you know how to configure messaging services for your application, you can try and move further.
Here are some things you might want to try:

. Check the https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka[full documentation] of the SmallRye Kafka extension in Quarkus.
. Try to set up some unit tests using the https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka#testing-a-kafka-application[in-memory reactive messaging Quarkus plugin].
. Try to experiment with different types of scenarios where the communication with Kafka might fail and think of ways those issues could be resolved.
