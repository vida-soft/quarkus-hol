== Reactive messaging with Kafka

At this moment we have learned how two applications can communicate with each-other using the RESTful interfaces offered by RestEasy.
The HTTP REST protocol works perfectly when the client wants to pass a request and is waiting for a response immediately after the request was sent.
In a small and controlled environment like our project structure here, this will happen lightning fast. 
You send a request and you get a response under a second.

In a real environments though, we don't usually tend to get things done so quick.
To make the user experience more seamless, we pretend that things have happened, before they do.

.A.N.(AmazoN) example
***************************
Imagine you are browsing through a shopping catalog in Amazon and you see something that you want to buy.
Sometimes Amazon will give you the option to purchase the item you're looking at with a single click (no payment and shipping confirmation required), other times it will ask you to provide payment data, address and etc.
Now what happens when you press the confirmation button to finalize your purchase?
Some 2-3 second later and you a confirmation that the order has been completed.

> But has it really completed? ðŸ¤”

The answer is no.
In order to not keep the user waiting, Amazon will show that the purchase has been done successfully and the customer is free to move on.
But underneath Amazon is processing thousands of purchases simultaneously.
Depending on RESTful services in such a scenario is inefficient.
Imagine having to wait on the huge line just to buy a ticket to watch a movie, and the movie is already running.
Nobody would visit that cinema again.

To prevent this from happening Amazon is using messaging services.
Let's see how the messaging services mitigate the process of purchasing an item:

. The customer checks out their purchase and completes the order.
. A REST call containing information about the order has been received inside an Amazon server.
. The server sends out an OK response to the front-end system to tell the customer that the order was completed.
. Asynchronously the server sends out a message to the various distributed services within Amazon about the purchase:
.. One reads that message and saves the order in the customer's order history
.. Another message goes to the delivery department to notify the systems that an order has to be processed
.. A third system will take the customer's payment details and conduct a payment transaction with the payment provider of choice
.. Finally when all the processes are completed another system will send the user an email about the completion state of the order.

In this scenario if the payment and shipment information was processed correctly, the user will receive an email that the order is completed and the items are being processed. If something fails, the customer will be notified through email or through the app/website to re-submit their details.
In the end this is creating a seamless flow, where the user experience seems smooth, the user can continue shopping or doing other stuff, while the order is being processed.
For the most scenarios there shouldn't be a problem with the payment and the order for recurring customers, so they for example can benefit from purchasing items without having to wait for the process to complete.

=== So what are messaging services?

Imagine a group chat with various participants but for web application services.
Instead of each service having to call one-another to exchange information, they will write to the group chat.
Let's use our aforementioned example and imagine it has three services:

* A "checkout" service that processes every order
* A "payments" service that will contact payment providers and charge the customer
* A "mailing" service that will collect various results from the services above and send emails to the customer

In a big platform like Amazon such a decentralization of services is needed in order to alleviate the high load of requests happening every second.
For most part all of the services will communicate using some kind of a messaging system.
Usually messaging systems like human ones have channels, threads or topics that substitute the groups and participants, that resemble the services themselves.
In our example the participants are our services and they write and read messages from various topics, doing various actions upon reading a message from the topic.

.This image displays a very simplified version of how applications can communicate through a messaging service.
image::messaging.png[align=center]

In a nutshell when an order is confirmed by the Checkout service, it will send a message to the Messaging service in a "group" called orders.
In that same group Mailing and Payments are also participants.
They will receive the message and act accordingly.
The payments service will call the payment provider using the customer's payment details and the Mailing service will assemble an email, confirming the customer's order and send it through an SMTP protocol.

Once the payment has been processed, if something fails, there might be another group chat (topic), called "Payment Failures" where Payments and Mailing participate.
If Payments writes to this topic, all other participants, such as Mailing, will read from it, and in the case of Mailing, it will assemble a an email stating what is wrong with the payments.

In all the stated scenarios, just like in real life, the service is not obligated to wait for the response of the other services.
They just write the message to the topic and move on to the next action.
The Checkout service does not need to know if the user's payment has went through.
The customer needs to know.
Therefore it is more convenient to notify them through email, instead of waiting for their details to be processed in a queue of dozen other order queries.

=== Messaging sounds good, but who's the messenger?

There are a lot of protocols and implementations of messaging services around the internet.
All of them might work differently, but at the end the goal is one and the same - an application writes to a central topic, where other applications can read from and vice-versa.

As mentioned, messages can be transmitted and received through various protocols, most popular of which are TCP, AMQP and MQTT.
Depending on the type and uses the applications have, we might want to implement different types of protocols for different scenarios.
TCP and AMQP messaging services for example are more advanced than MQTT, whereas MQTT is lightweight and allows for better communication between IoT devices.

For the purpose of our course we are going to look through one of the most popular messaging service implementations, called Apache Kafka.
Kafka is using the TCP protocol to allow communication between its components and participants. In the following section you'll be able to learn more about Kafka in a summary.

.What is Apache Kafka?
***************************
**Apache Kafka** (or Kafka for short) is an open-source distributed event streaming platform designed for handling real-time data feeds. It facilitates the seamless flow of data between different systems, enabling efficient communication in distributed architectures.

In other words, Kafka allows for two applications to communicate through so-called topics, where one application writes to the topic an the other reads from it.

Kafka works, through the following principles:

. **Push-Subscribe Model:**
- Kafka follows a publish-subscribe model, where data is published to topics by producers.
- Consumers subscribe to specific topics to receive and process the published data.
. **Topics and Partitions:**
- Data is organized into topics, acting as channels for communication.
- Topics are further divided into partitions to enable parallel processing and scalability.
. **Producers and Consumers:**
- **Producers:** Applications that send data to Kafka topics.
- **Consumers:** Applications that subscribe to topics and process the data.
. **Broker Architecture:**
- Kafka operates with a distributed architecture consisting of multiple servers called brokers.
- Brokers store and manage the data, ensuring fault tolerance and high availability.

To be able to work with Kafka, we nee to learn the names and purpose of each participant component:

. **Producer:**
- Responsible for publishing data to Kafka topics.
- Ensures the delivery of messages to the specified topics.
. **Consumer:**
- Subscribes to topics to receive and process data.
- Can be part of a consumer group for load balancing and fault tolerance.
. **Broker:**
- Kafka servers that store and manage data.
- Each broker in a cluster is aware of the data distribution and can serve as a leader or follower for partitions.
. **Topic:**
- A logical channel for data streams.
- Data is organized into topics, and each topic can have multiple partitions.
. **Partition:**
- Divides a topic into smaller, independently manageable segments.
- Enables parallel processing and scalable data consumption.
. **Zookeeper:**
- Coordinates and manages the Kafka brokers in a distributed setup.
- Maintains configuration information, leader election, and synchronization.

In summary, Apache Kafka simplifies real-time data streaming by providing a robust infrastructure for handling large-scale, distributed data flows among different components and systems.
***************************

Now understanding Kafka, let's see how our Amazon application participants would use it in a real-life scenario

image::kafka.png[align=center]

NOTE: The image shows a hypothetical scenario how Kafka could work as a messaging service with Amazon's services.
A zookeeper may contain more than one broker and each service would read from/write to the first available broker it gets connected to.

=== Applying Kafka to our project

Now that we know what Kafka is and how it works, let's see how it could be applied to our project.

Currently, we have created our MagMan project for the Magazine Manager and SpendPal, that is responsible for charging our customers for the subscription services.
The way it works is the MagMan performs a REST call to SpendPal every time we want to charge a customer.
Let's visualize how this flow works right now.

image::rest-communication.png[align=center]

As we can see from our sophisticated diagram, the process requires for the subscriber to wait for SpendPal to process the payment request, before getting a response.
Just as mentioned earlier, this process wouldn't take that long if there were a couple of customers to pay for this feature, but we're using the power of
distributed web applications for way bigger scenarios.
Imagine if the customer was not just one, but hundreds or even thousands of them.
This is the point where REST services would bottleneck the user experience, as each payment will have to wait in line to be processed and the customer will not be able to use the platform meanwhile.

Now let's see how our diagram would look if we add the Kafka infrastructure to our service...

image::magman-kafka.png[align=center]

Now regardless if the diagram looks a bit more intimidating, if we follow along we can see, that:

. The user makes a payment providing their payment details
. MagMan sends a message to a Kafka topic to notify all its listeners that a payment has occurred
. Then the service acts immediately to activate the user's subscription, without waiting for confirmation
. The user gets the confirmation from MagMan and can move onto using the site
. The rest of the process is managed in the background without the subscriber's knowledge,
i.e. the payment gets processed and the SpendPal service returns a response message in a separate dedicated topic, which is read by MagMan
. If the result of the payment was successful, we can allow the user to continue using the site, without any interventions, if not,
we might trigger a mechanism to stop the user from using the website and ask them to provide payment information again.

[NOTE]
====
The scenario played here is just hypothetical.
For most services it might be crucial for the payment to be successful in order to use them, but in our scenario, we consider
that the probability of the payment to fail and the time the user will use our service will be too short to create any financial loss into using our service,
therefore we can allow the user to use our platform without interruptions, while we process the payment.

You can see the same scenario in airplanes for example.
Since no radio waves are allowed on the plane, all payments are processed offline and once the plane is on ground, all the payments are requested from
the customers' bank accounts.
In the meanwhile customers will get their goodies, regardless if the payment was successful or not.
Resolving unclaimed payments is up to the policy of the flight company.
====

With messaging systems we want to implement one way communication as each message payload is unique to the dedicated topic.
We also do not want to double read a topic when we publish something in it.
This is the reason behind having two topics to write and read from.

- The `payments` topic is designed to be read only by SpendPal service.
It will contain data regarding payment information, such as credit card info, subscription type and so on.
- The `post-payments` topic is designed to be read by MagMan.
It will contain, as the name suggests, post payment information, such as the payment status, timestamps, any error messages and so on.

Both topics are read and written to in a queue (FIFO) manner, meaning that we read the messages from top to bottom and every new message will be read and processed when the previous message
has completed processing.
Once the message was read, the Kafka broker will remember which messages were read and will provide the subscriber applications only with the unread messages.
