== Role-based access control with MicroProfile JWT

When you deal with web applications no matter, big or small, you would want to identify who is using the application and what they do with it.
A typical approach to do this is with a web session.
In the Java world a session is usually handled with a cookie, called "jsessionid".
This cookie resembles a token, which maps to an object instance within the Java web application.
Using that session token, we are able to identify users in our database, decide whether they should have access on a resource and what content should they receive.

There are some problems with approach.
If the application gets restarted by a reason, the session will end, and the user will need to reauthenticate, so they can use the server again.
Moreover the approach is not suitable for distributed systems.
It works well for a single deployment of the application, but imagine if you had something more wide distributed, like Google.
There are multiple Google servers all over the world, running the same code.
And they exist, so that your queries can get to the nearest server, so that all the billion users get to have the best and fastest experience they could, instead of waiting millions of requests to be processed by a single server.
In this kind of scenario one query can be processed by one server and another, by another server and all the servers will know who you are.
Your session is everywhere.
 +
Also since Quarkus is stateless and does manage sessions, we are not able to use that jsessoionid cookie to maintain user content and access.
Fortunately, a more modern approach exists.
This approach is being adopted by a lot of web services nowadays.
And it's name is Json Web Token (JWT).

.What is JWT?
***************************
Json Web Token  is an open standard (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[RFC 7519]), used to transfer claims between two parties.
As the name suggests, JWT resembles JSON object and it consists of three parts:

- *Header* (algorithm and token type)
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
----

- *Payload* - combination of claims, user roles and other useful user data, such as issue time, expiration time and etc.
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true,
  "iat": 1516239022
}
---- 

- *Signature* - generated signature, based on the algorithm and key/certificate.
It is used to help parties verify the legitimacy of the claims.
Think of it as the validity measures, placed on your id card.

At the end the key is encoded in base 64 and it looks like this

[source,jwt]

***************************

The payload of the token can be modified to store any data that is required for the web application to identify the user, although it is recommended to be brief. 
The more data you put inside your JWT, the bigger the request will get, which will cause slower processing.

=== Configuring Quarkus for JWT

A JWT is passed to the user upon successful login.
The user makes a request to the server with their credentials and in response they get the token either in the response's header or inside the body.
Once that token is obtained, the client should take it, and place it inside the `Authorization` header of every following request.
MicroProfile JWT is capable to automatically parse that header, read its contents and validate the authority of the signature.
With the annotations the specification provides, the developer is capable of then securing the application's endpoints however they please.

First thing we are going to do is prepare our project for JWT.
Usually in applications, consisting of multiple microservices there will be one central service, responsible for issuing JWT tokens to the application.
https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak] is such an example.
It provides multiple ways for users to authenticate, convenient role management and nice user interface to suit the needs of regular users.
 +
In our project, though, we are not going to use centralized authentication service.
We are going to implement something more simple, that is just going to suit our needs for the examples.

==== Adding JWT extension

The first step, as always, when it comes to something new, is to add extension.

[source,shell]
----
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-jwt"
----

==== Creating SSL key pair

NOTE: For this step you are required to have OpenSSL installed.
If you are running on a Unix-based system, you probably already have it.

To sign our JWT tokens, we are going to need a pair of public and private keys, our application will be using.
Usually the private key is needed for the issuer to sign the JWT.
The public key is then used by the web applications to verify the signature.

. Create a folder called `jwt` somewhere in your system.
. Create the private key
+
[source,shell]
----
openssl genrsa -out /dir/to/private.pem 2048
----

. Next step is to create the public key:
+
[source,shell]
----
openssl rsa -in /dir/to/private.pem -pubout -outform PEM -out /dir/to/public_key.pem
----

. Finally we need a private PKCS8 key.
This format is supported by Quarkus.
+
[source,shell]
----
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in /dir/to/private.pem -out /dir/to/private_key.pem -nocrypt
----

NOTE: It's unnecessary to, but we should mention not to forget to set the `/dir/to/` part to your folder's directory, where you will store the keys.

Now that this is done, it is time to go to our `application.properties` file and point to the key's location.

[source,application.properties]
----
mp.jwt.verify.privatekey.location=path/to/private_key.pem
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=path/to/public_key.pem
----

TIP: If you decide to store the keys in your application (to keep some default keys for development environments for example), you can do it inside `resources/META-INF` directory, and refer to it, by setting the value `META-INF/path/to/private_key.pem`

==== Configuring the issuing of JWT keys

Since JWT is normally issued by centralized service it is not part of the MicroProfile JWT spec to issue tokens.
But for convenience we are gonna do it anyways.

Inside your `security` package, create a new class, called `JwtService`

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class JwtService {

    private static final Map<Class<? extends User>, String> ROLE_MAP = Map.of(
            Author.class, Author.ROLE_NAME,
            Subscriber.class, Subscriber.ROLE_NAME,
            Manager.class, Manager.ROLE_NAME
    );

    private PrivateKey privateKey;

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "mp.jwt.verify.privatekey.location")
    String keyLocation;

    @PostConstruct
    public void initializePrivateKey() {
        try {
            privateKey = readPrivateKey();  <.>
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public String generateJWT(User user, long expirationTime) {

        long currentTimeInSeconds = System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000;

        JwtClaimsBuilder claimsBuilder = Jwt.claims();
        claimsBuilder.issuer("http://localhost");
        claimsBuilder.upn(user.id + "");
        claimsBuilder.subject(ROLE_MAP.get(user.getClass())); <.>
        claimsBuilder.groups(ROLE_MAP.get(user.getClass()));
        claimsBuilder.issuedAt(currentTimeInSeconds);
        claimsBuilder.expiresAt(currentTimeInSeconds + 1800); // 30 minutes <.>

        claimsBuilder.claim(Claims.auth_time.name(), currentTimeInSeconds);

        return claimsBuilder.jws().sign(privateKey);
    }

    private PrivateKey readPrivateKey() {
        try (InputStream contentIS = getKeyStream(keyLocation)) {
            byte[] tmp = new byte[4096];
            try {
                int length = contentIS.read(tmp);
                return decodePrivateKey(new String(tmp, 0, length));
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Could not read private key", ex);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return null;
        }
    }

    private InputStream getKeyStream(String keyLocation) throws IOException {
        var key = new File(keyLocation);

        return key.exists() ? new FileInputStream(key) :
                this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(keyLocation);
    }


    private static PrivateKey decodePrivateKey(final String pemEncoded) throws Exception{
        byte[] encodedBytes = toEncodedBytes(pemEncoded);

        PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(encodedBytes);
        KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance("RSA");
        return keyFactory.generatePrivate(keySpec);
    }

    private static byte[] toEncodedBytes(final String pemEncoded) {
        final String normalizedPem = removeBeginEnd(pemEncoded);
        return Base64.getDecoder().decode(normalizedPem);
    }

    private static String removeBeginEnd(String pem) {
        pem = pem.replaceAll("-----BEGIN (.*)-----", "");
        pem = pem.replaceAll("-----END (.*)----", "");
        pem = pem.replaceAll("\r\n", "");
        pem = pem.replaceAll("\n", "");
        return pem.trim();
    }

}

----
<.> As a start we need to manually parse the private key, from the file location we pointed in `application.properties`.
<.> Here we set the role both in `subject` and `groups`.
Some clients may want to read it from either location.
<.> Json Web Tokens are meant to be temporal, just like any user session. 
Just like cookies if the users are not careful, they might get their JWTs stolen.
It is recommended that we keep sessions small, and ask the user to issue a new JWT. 
Thirty minutes is just about ok.

Other methods are just involved around reading the key and doing some encoding.

Next step is to invoke the method inside the `login` endpoint.

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped
@Path("user")
public class UserResource {

    //some definitions

    @Inject
    JwtService jwtService;

    // some more methods


    @POST
    @Path("login")
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Response loginUser(@Valid @NotNull LoginDTO login) {
        Optional<User> loggedUser = userService.loginUser(login.getUserName(), login.getPassword());
        return loggedUser
                .map(u -> Response.ok(new UserDTO(u))
                        .header("Authorization", jwtService.generateJWT(u)) // Don't miss our jwt
                        .build())
                .orElseGet(() -> Response.status(Response.Status.UNAUTHORIZED).build());
    }

}
----

Now if we make login request, we should see our JWT in the response header.

[source,curl]
----
curl -i --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/user/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "password": "manager",
    "userName": "manager"
}'
----

The response will be:

[source,json]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Authorization: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2xvY2FsaG9zdCIsInVwbiI6Im1hbmFnZXJAdmlkYS1zb2Z0LmNvbSIsInN1YiI6Ik1BTkFHRVIiLCJpYXQiOjE2NjUwNzA2NDcsImV4cCI6MTY2NTA3MjQ0NywiZ3JvdXBzIjpbIk1BTkFHRVIiXSwiYXV0aF90aW1lIjoxNjY1MDcwNjQ3LCJqdGkiOiJhNWI0MDQzYS03YjA1LTRhNTktOWFiMS03YzM0MWI4MTMwZDUifQ.NLGCkTVAWjoRGxR40whId55NMQKLmJVt3wvh-dliooHxkpXHcGBxa260QpMDJ_Aok6uSE2qS2r-POXyl7lsSvx_YkdTzEJEKrJlN-_9c6yqVYioa5N9vaa83FYpyGHgxtzf67UnWTiDsM_A-_KhRrgN9f3uGaQCqhh4XIg3PbG2VGC2gVNTlhnFsyNBArC2igux00ZiXeJrUFqaWskbN4nKVrv_ADXBVsL0GJj9A-ltqkbo8e-gOgRgS084IcAkHCOSbChTYTE4u9bNr65hGAgentZvwIvr70SQvwlnY7JqXiYMTwln1acnamMUM5r4bz8p2s37pol9psZhOrdDUzg
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 94

{"email":"manager@vida-soft.com","firstName":"Manager","lastName":"User","userName":"manager"}
----

And if we take that key and decode it, we are going to see the following json.

[source,json]
----
{
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "RS256"
}{
    "iss": "https://localhost",
    "upn": "manager@vida-soft.com",

The characters at the end resemble the signature, we did with our private key.

=== Using MP JWT API

Now since we are able to issue JWT tokens, we can move onto setting protection to our endpoints.
The first annotation we are going to look at is `@Authenticated`.

==== The `@Authenticated` annotation

This annotation works both on class and on method level.
By default adding the JWT extension does not protect your endpoints from access.
You wouldn't have been able to use the login endpoint if they were.
When you want to protect a single/all endpoints of a resource class, without limiting the users' access to it, you can just use the `@Authorized` annotation.
This will make the access to an endpoint restricted only for the non-authorized users.

To test this, let's place the annotation on `ArticleResource` and try to get all articles.

[source,curl]
----
curl -i --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/article/'
----

You will immediately get a response:

[source,text]
----
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
www-authenticate: Bearer
content-length: 0
----

The call won't even enter the method.
Since you already know how interceptors work, you get the idea how this worked.

Now let's try again, by getting our authentication token and build a query, that will let us view all articles

[source,curl]
----
curl -i --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/article/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2xvY2FsaG9zdCIsInVwbiI6Im1hbmFnZXJAdmlkYS1zb2Z0LmNvbSIsInN1YiI6Ik1BTkFHRVIiLCJpYXQiOjE2NjUwNzA2NDcsImV4cCI6MTY2NTA3MjQ0NywiZ3JvdXBzIjpbIk1BTkFHRVIiXSwiYXV0aF90aW1lIjoxNjY1MDcwNjQ3LCJqdGkiOiJhNWI0MDQzYS03YjA1LTRhNTktOWFiMS03YzM0MWI4MTMwZDUifQ.NLGCkTVAWjoRGxR40whId55NMQKLmJVt3wvh-dliooHxkpXHcGBxa260QpMDJ_Aok6uSE2qS2r-POXyl7lsSvx_YkdTzEJEKrJlN-_9c6yqVYioa5N9vaa83FYpyGHgxtzf67UnWTiDsM_A-_KhRrgN9f3uGaQCqhh4XIg3PbG2VGC2gVNTlhnFsyNBArC2igux00ZiXeJrUFqaWskbN4nKVrv_ADXBVsL0GJj9A-ltqkbo8e-gOgRgS084IcAkHCOSbChTYTE4u9bNr65hGAgentZvwIvr70SQvwlnY7JqXiYMTwln1acnamMUM5r4bz8p2s37pol9psZhOrdDUzg'
----

IMPORTANT: Using the `Bearer` word, before passing the token is mandatory.
The authorization header can take different types of authorization tokens, and specifying the type of authentication before passing the token is needed.
If you miss it, the authentication will not work.

==== The `@RolesAllowed` annotation

This annotation will limit the access to users with certain role.
It could be placed on a method or a class level.
Placing this on a method or a class, fully replaces the `@Authenticated` annotation. Just as the `@Authenticated` 's documentation states - _"Indicates that a resource can only be accessed by a logged in user. This is equivalent to the Jakarta EE8 RolesAllowed("**") construct."_

For our ArticleResource we want articles to only be created/edited by Authors, deleted by Authors and Managers, and the manager should be able to control the advertisers on an article.
To achieve this behavior, we need to do it like this:

[source,java]
----
@Authenticated
@RequestScoped
@Path("/article")
public class ArticleResource {

    @Inject
    ArticleService articleService;

    @POST
    @Transactional
    @RolesAllowed({Author.ROLE_NAME})
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Response createArticle(@Valid @NotNull ArticleDTO articleDTO) {...}

    @GET
    @Path("/{id}")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Response getArticle(@Positive @PathParam("id") Long articleId) {...}

    @PUT
    @Transactional
    @Path("/{id}")
    @RolesAllowed({Author.ROLE_NAME})
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Response editArticle(@Positive @PathParam("id") Long articleId, @Valid @NotNull ArticleDTO articleDTO) {...}

    @DELETE
    @Transactional
    @Path("/{id}")
    @RolesAllowed({Author.ROLE_NAME, Manager.ROLE_NAME})
    public void deleteArticle(@Positive @PathParam("id") Long articleId) {...}

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Response getArticles(@QueryParam("page") @DefaultValue("1") @Positive int page,
                                @QueryParam("size") @DefaultValue("10") @Positive int size,
                                @QueryParam("author") @Positive Long authorId) {...}

    @PATCH
    @Transactional
    @RolesAllowed({Manager.ROLE_NAME})
    @Path("{id}/advertiser/{advertiserId}")
    public Response addAdvertiserToArticle(@Positive @PathParam("id") Long id, @Positive @PathParam("advertiserId") Long advertiserId) {...}
}
----

We are going to leave the `@GET` methods alone, as they need to be accessed by all users.
Now if we try to create an article with the manager or any other than author user, we are going to get:

[source,text]
----
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
content-length: 0
----

If you use the right roles required for the annotations, you are going to get access to the endpoint.
If not, you are never going to be able to access them.

=== Getting data from the JWT

Sometimes restricting the access by role is not enough.
For example we do not want one author to edit the article of another author.
Also when an author creates an article, we want to identify them, without making them do it, by passing the `authorId` in the DTO.
We can already get that from the token.

Let's make a `@PostConstruct` method which is going to help us identify the user, before going to the article methods.

[source,java]
----
public class ArticleResource {
    
    @Inject
    JsonWebToken jwt; <.>

    User loggedUser;

    @PostConstruct
    void init() {
        Long userId = Long.parseLong(jwt.getClaim("upn")); <.>
        loggedUser = User.findById(userId); <.>
    }

    // sweet, sweet endpoints ahead
}
----
<.> Just like everything CDI-ish, we can inject an instance of the `JsonWebToken` class, which holds the user's token deconstructed.
<.> Then from that token, we can take the user's id from the `upn` claim.
This is where we previously contained the user id, when we made the claim issuing code.
The `upm` claim is the standard place, where you will place identification details about the user.
<.> Since `upn` claim takes only string as a value, then we need to parse it back to long and use it in a query.

Next step is to update the methods which require to check the user that is performing the operation.

[source,java]
----
public class ArticleResource {

    public Response createArticle(@Valid @NotNull ArticleDTO articleDTO) {
        Author author = (Author) loggedUser;
        if (author == null) {
            return Response.status(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST).build();
        } else {
            Article article = articleService.createArticle(articleDTO.getTitle(), articleDTO.getContent(), author);
            return Response.created(URI.create(String.format("article/%s", article.id))).build();
        }
    }

    public Response editArticle(@Positive @PathParam("id") Long articleId, @Valid @NotNull ArticleDTO articleDTO) {
        Article article = Article.findById(articleId);

        if (article == null) {
            return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
        } else if (!loggedUser.equals(article.author)) { <.>
            return Response.status(Response.Status.FORBIDDEN).build();
        } else {
            articleService.editArticle(article, articleDTO.getTitle(), articleDTO.getContent());
            return Response.ok(new ArticleDTO(article)).build();
        }
    }

    @DELETE
    @Transactional
    @Path("/{id}")
    @RolesAllowed({Author.ROLE_NAME, Manager.ROLE_NAME})
    public void deleteArticle(@Positive @PathParam("id") Long articleId) {
        Article.delete(articleId, loggedUser.id); <.>
    }
}
----
<.> Assuming AbstractEntity.equals is overridden
<.> Here we have added a named query into `Article` entity, to delete an article where the author's id matches the one of the logged user or if the user is a manager: `delete from Article a where a.id = :articleId and (a.author.id = :userId or (select count (m) from Manager m where m.id = :userId) > 0)`.
Don't forget to surround the part starting from `author.id` with brackets, otherwise you are going to delete all articles when you do it with the manager.

TIP: You should also create methods to delete all related to the article comments, beforehand.

=== What can I do now?

Now you have all the basis of RBAC with MP JWT.
Why don't you get a bit wild, and start protecting all of your endpoints in a way that it would make sense.
You could also create a producer for the logged user, to avoid making the same `@PostConstruct` method everywhere when you need it.
