== Project structure with Quarkus and Maven

Now that we have successfully created our project, let's get to know its structure, so we can comfortably know our way around.

=== Configuring your IDE for the project

Since we are working with abstract and sophisticated matter, let's first load our project into our IDE.
All Java IDEs are supporting the Java/Jakarta EE annotations, and most popular ones such as IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse support the Quarkus framework out of the box, which means the IDE will know how to set up your environment the moment you load the project there.

For the purpose of this course we are going to use IntelliJ IDEA, but you can go along with any IDE, you feel more comfortable with.

To load the project, simply click `Open` from the project selection window or `File -> Open` and choose the folder of your project.
IntelliJ should quickly recognize your project and framework and create a runner.
If no runner has been created, you can easily add it yourself.

.Click on `Add Configuration` -> `+` -> `Quarkus` -> `OK`

Other than that, no other configurations are needed.

Now let's start your project and make sure it's configured properly.
First make sure you have stopped all other processes, you previously started running `mvn quarkus:dev`.
Then run the project from your IDE.
To test that your application is running fine, let's make that curl call once more:

=== Looking at our project file tree

Having our project configured, now it is time to look at our file tree.

Most of the project's structure is common to a lot of Java Enterprise projects, but we are going run through it anyways, to make sure, we are on the same page.

Starting off with the `src/main` folder, we have three important directories:

- `docker` is the folder where your https://docker.io[Docker] configurations will be.
Quarkus has provided an easy way to create docker images for your project, so you can use Maven and build/deploy those with a single command.
- `java` will be the directory where your code will be.
Folders under this one are considered as packages.
It is recommended that you write your code under the package of your project domain, as shown in the image.
- `resources` is the folder where your project's resources will be.
Here you can see stuff as configuration properties (`application.properties`), and other templates, presets or files, your project will use for a particular purpose, based on the project's needs.
- `application.properties` is the file where all system configurations will go.
We will look at how these properties come in hand in a further chapter.
- `META-INF/resources` is a directory specific for the Quarkus framework. This directory would contain server content that needs rendering.
If you try to load http://localhost:8080 in a browser, you will be welcomed to a greeting page, generated by Quarkus, to assure you that the project is up and running.
We are going to modify our project and change that as we go to serve as a demo page to our front-end for our back-end server.
- `test` folder as you guessed serves as a folder where our tests will be.
Here the structure is mirrored to the `main` folder and we can use it to write tests for our application.

In the next chapter we are going to look through our first Jakarta EE specification, the Java Persistence API or JPA for short.
